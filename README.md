### Goal
Our goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of in-game events and challenges in driving up gamer engagement in GTA V Online.

### Methodology
We use a period of 21 days in each of our plots: the week before the event, the week of the event, and the week after the event.
We analyzed three main player metrics: time spent, money spent, and activities.

### Discussion
Based on the discussion of our data shown earlier, that player engagement generally increases the week after the event. This suggests that during event weeks, players are engaged in participating in those events and purchasing items that have discounts. This leads to a short-term fall in activities but a spike in activities in the week after as players use their purchased items and re-engage with more rewarding in-game activities.

### Recommendations
We saw that player engagement was generally higher during the week of the Heist Challenge event compared to the Halloween event. This suggests that violent events drive up higher engagement than plain discounts. We recommend Rockstar use challenges over discounts to drive up user engagement.
